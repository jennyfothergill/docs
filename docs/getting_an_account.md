In order to grant access, the HPC administrator will verify that you are a valid user by contacting the projectâ€™s PI.
When on the Boise State campus, the campus clusters can be accessed from most wired computers or from the secured Eduroam Wi-Fi network.
If you are off campus, a VPN connection must be used.
The Boise State VPN is a virtual network connection that allows users to be on the internal network from off campus.
More info on it can be found here: [vpn-services](https://www.boisestate.edu/oit-network/vpn-services/).
The VPN is only accessible to current employees and student employees of Boise State, so if you need VPN access, please have your faculty advisor/PI contact the help desk to request VPN access on your behalf.
